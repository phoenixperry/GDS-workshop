# Welcome to The Hatch Lab Hackerspace! 
This space serves to provide increased STEM access to the Goldsmiths Computing Students and the researchers within the Computing  Department. 

As a shared space, it’s very important we set up some ground rules and user polices so this space can support the community. What follows is a list of policies and guidelines for using this space, the gear in it and how we treat each other. 

This space isn’t just a lab where you drop in and out and someone else builds your project. That’s not the way of the Jedi. We are a community where we all hack together to create new frontiers at the edges of what is possible in our field. Give as much as you get. If you learn to solder, why not teach your skills to those around you? This process builds up a healthy, strong community that supports growth, innovation and shared knowledge. 

**Together we know more.**

## About the space: 
This room, the former GDS, is now the temporary home to The Goldsmiths Hatch Lab Hackerspace. Eventually, we will be opening a much larger facility. While construction is occurring on our final home, this space will serve as a testing ground for policies, space use and the levels of access. How this project succeeds or fails shapes the future of the lab and it’s up to us to help us define the levels of openness, access and resources we have. Together we will build an inspiring community in the Lewisham Area that highlights the creative and engineering efforts of our community.   

### Participate! 
Hours the space is available are posted on the door every week. 

Access to this space comes in two forms. Unlimited member access and non-member limited access. Membership is not guaranteed to all.  

#### Training Sessions to become a member
Access to this space is a privilege, not a right and it can be revoked if a user violates the polices laid out for the space. 

To get unsupervised access to this space and become a full member it’s very important you attend a training session. Sessions run on a per term basis. Please attend the announced session. If you want to know when the next one runs, see the door of the Hatch Lab and keep an eye on your email. If you need access and you’re not in one of the groups with access, you can email p.perry@gold.ac.uk to request access. It will only be granted on a case by case basis as our support and faculty allows. 

#### Craft Nights  
The first Thursday of every month from 6.15 until 8ish this space is open to our Goldsmiths Community. Computing’s resident hackers will be around hacking and sharing knowledge and everyone, including non-members, are encouraged to join and bring something awesome to work on. 

There will be mini-skills bootcamps, genius hackers visiting unannounced and general impromptu fun. The only way to know what’s happening is to turn up and take part. 

There will be music! 

There will be science! 

And yes, there will be magic. 

Bring snacks, bring friends and prepare to build stuff. Get over here for Craft Night! What are you waiting for? 

### Equipment Use Guidelines 
Equipment in the space is precious. Respect it. Misuse of gear will result in suspension of access to the space until you have been retrained the following term and possible replacement fees depending on damages. Are you are unsure how to use something? See below for a comprehensive list of learning resources. If you notice a fellow member not using a piece of gear correctly, it would be considerate if you help them out and inform them on proper usage. There are no new budgets to buy more gear. Everyone loses when something is damaged. 

**If you destroy a piece of gear, you will be required to replace it. **

Below are guidelines for each item:

* Wire strippers 

	This is how to cut wire and use the strippers: 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Nyzq3CzlI][1]

* Handtools 

	There are various hand tools around the lab. If you use one, put it back where you found it when you are done with it. 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-1phA\_vKDg&list=PLjF7R1fz\_OOU08\_hRcayfVZSmTpBCGJbL][2] 


* Soldering 

	First off, this is how to solder: 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg][3]
	  
	More information on getting setup, the right iron temp and how to set up here: 
	[http://makezine.com/2011/01/06/skill-set-soldering/][4]

	If you need a soldering iron, you are required to **turn the iron off** when you are done. Failure to do so can ruin the irons and mean that no one can ever use it again. It’s vital to do this. You will be charged a replacement cost for the iron.  

	Did it not work? Check out desoldering to try it again! 

* Desoldering 

	This is how to use a solder sucker and solder wick: 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N\_dvf45hN6Y][5]
	When you are done desoldering, place the tool back on the soldering station you are using. 	

* Multimeter 

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPGoMbVSUu8][6]
	When you are done, turn the meter of and place the tool back on the soldering station you are using.  

* Oscilloscope

	What is this magic thing? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThrK2spjrLs][7]

	When you are done, turn the scope off and place it back on the table where you found it. 

* Variable Power Supply

	How to use it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr89UbofNgw][8]

	When you are done, turn the supply off and place it back on the table where you found it. 

* 3D Printing 

	Wanna use the 3D Printer? Awesome! They live in the WB100 space, not this room. Now before you get started know that you are responsible for making sure it works when you are finished with it for the next user. 

	**If you break the printer by misusing it, you have to fix it yourself by the end of the day or pay to have it repaired by a licensed technician of the Department of Computing’s choice. **
	  
	Only members have access to these machines.

* Laser Cutter 

	Until further notice, this piece of gear is for researchers only. Soon this will change. 

* Circular Woodsaw

	While using the saw, you are required to wear eye and ear protection. After cutting wood, you are required to vacuum the lab and wipe off any dust on any surface. Use only at your own risk after proper training. When you are done, place the tool back on the cabinet where you found it.

	Part 2 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0IcTl8D91Q][12]

* Jigsaw 

	While using the saw, you are required to wear eye and ear protection. After cutting wood, you are required to vacuum the lab and wipe off any dust on any surface. You are also required to bring your own blade. Use only at your own risk after proper training. When you are done, place the tool back on the cabinet where you found it.

#### A word on consumables
(Or as they are called in one hackerspace, Thingsgiving.) 
 
There are some parts members can use freely in the lab in a consumables station. These materials are vital for physical computing students and are meant to last through the creation of exhibition projects. Anything taken from this area should be returned if possible when you are done with it. The budget for these supplies is extremely small and it’s not an endless resource. If materials are stolen and the bins are all stripped clean, this entire station might no longer be possible for Computing to maintain. 

#### Want to donate to the consumables? 
Did you have functional left over parts you will no longer need or order a bag of parts so large you have no idea how you’d ever use it all? Why not donate some materials back to your fellow students? Consumables donations can be left in the open bin under the table the consumables sit on. 

**If you take something, giving something of equal usefulness and value is generally a nice rule to follow.**   

## Security 
##### The staff cam  
Everyone hates security cameras. That said, there is a live camera feed in the space that staff have access too. We do this so we can check in when we are not around in the building physically to make sure everything running according to plan. This feed will never be made publicly available and is here only for our own monitoring of the room.  

##### Access 
Giving access to the space to non-members outside of Craft Night or explicitly stated events is forbidden. If you do this, you will lose your own access for the rest of the academic year. 

##### Damage  
If you damage a piece of gear, the best thing to do is let the staff know and we’ll assess if it needs to be replaced and if you will be held responsible for the damage. 

If materials are damaged and unreported, we will review our footage to track down how it happened and who used the gear last.  

##### Code of Conduct 
One of the goals of the Hactchlab is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic status, age, level of experience, personal appearance, ethnicity, religion or philosophy.

The lab is a safe space where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and on social media. Particularly, we want to remind participants and visitors to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, exclusion, or other disrespectful conduct. We promise each other to:
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, we contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
	* Exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions.
	* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
	* Be mindful of other community members.

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to physical harassment, verbal harassment, and any form of sexual assault. Those who violate this policy will either be directed to leave the premises or reported to the authorities.

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please talk with a member of staff.  

Alert the faculty if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. 

We'll treat reports as anonymous submissions, and do our best to work with everyone in private to resolve the conflict.
  
Concerns can be privately emailed to: p.perry@gold.ac.uk 

##### Terms of Agreement 
This is the end of the general use agreement. By entering into this room and using these facilities, you agree to the above terms of use. This agreement will be reviewed in detail at all induction sessions for new members. 

If you abject to these terms, you must notify a member of staff immediately after your induction training session. At that point, you will lose access to the room via swipe card and will only be allowed in the space during supervised classes. Additionally, all tools and resources will be off limits to you.

#### What the heck is the difference between a small computing platform and a micro controller? 

The small computers are computers. They are far more advanced, have much larger memories, USB ports, video displays and usually their own GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins you can program that will give you control over sensors and actuators. 

A micro controller is much less. It’s usually got a very limited memory like 64k and can only write and read the GPIO pins on the board itself. There’s no saving data here really. If you want to save data you’ll need to have a connected computer and send the data out from the micro controller to a computer.

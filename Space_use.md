# Welcome to The Hatch Lab Hackerspace! 
This space serves to provide increased STEM access to the Goldsmiths student body and the researchers within the Computing  Department. 

As a shared space, it’s very important we set up some ground rules and user polices so this space can support the community. What follows is a list of policies and guidelines for using this space, the gear in it and how we treat each other. 

This space isn’t just a lab where you drop in and out and someone else builds your project. That’s not the way of the Jedi. We are a community where we all hack together to create new frontiers at the edges of what is possible in our field. Give as much as you get. If you learn to solder, why not teach your skills to those around you? This process builds up a healthy, strong community that supports growth, innovation and shared knowledge. 

**Together we know more.**

## About the space: 
This room, the former GDS, is now the temporary home to The Goldsmiths Hatch Lab Hackerspace. Eventually, we will be opening a much larger facility. While construction is occurring on our final home, this space will serve as a testing ground for policies, space use and the levels of access. How this project succeeds or fails shapes the future of the lab and it’s up to us to help us define the levels of openness, access and resources we have. Together we will build an inspiring community in the Lewisham Area that highlights the creative and engineering efforts of our community.   

## Participate! 
Hours the space is available are posted on the door every week. 

Access to this space comes in two forms. Unlimited member access and non-member limited access. Membership is not guaranteed to all.  

### Training Sessions to become a member
Access to this space is a privilege, not a right and it can be revoked if a user violates the polices laid out for the space. 

To get unsupervised access to this space and become a full member it’s very important you attend a training session. Sessions run on a per term basis. Please attend the announced session. If you want to know when the next one runs, see the door of the Hatch Lab and keep an eye on your email. If you need access and you’re not in one of the groups with access, you can email p.perry@gold.ac.uk to request access. It will only be granted on a case by case basis as our support and faculty allows. 

### Craft Nights  
The first Thursday of every month from 6.15 until 8ish this space is open to our Goldsmiths Community. Computing’s resident hackers will be around hacking and sharing knowledge and everyone, including non-members, are encouraged to join and bring something awesome to work on. 

There will be mini-skills bootcamps, genius hackers visiting unannounced and general impromptu fun. The only way to know what’s happening is to turn up and take part. 

There will be music! 

There will be science! 

And yes, there will be magic. 

Bring snacks, bring friends and prepare to build stuff. Get over here for Craft Night! What are you waiting for? 

#### Responsibility
Equipment in the space is precious. Respect it. Misuse of gear will result in suspension of access to the space until you have been retrained the following term and possible replacement fees depending on damages. Are you are unsure how to use something? See below for a comprehensive list of learning resources. If you notice a fellow member not using a piece of gear correctly, it would be considerate if you help them out and inform them on proper usage. There are no new budgets to buy more gear. Everyone loses when something is damaged. Also, if you destroy a piece of gear, you will be required to replace it. 

Below are guidelines for each item:

* Wire strippers 

	This is how to cut wire and use the strippers:

* Handtools 

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-1phA\_vKDg&list=PLjF7R1fz\_OOU08\_hRcayfVZSmTpBCGJbL][2] 

* Soldering 

	First off, this is how to solder: 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg][3]
	  
	More information on getting setup, the right iron temp and how to set up here: 
	[http://makezine.com/2011/01/06/skill-set-soldering/][4]

	If you need a soldering iron, you are required to **turn the iron off** when you are done. Failure to do so can ruin the irons and mean that no one can ever use it again. It’s vital to do this.  

	Did it not work? Check out desoldering to try it again! 

* Desoldering 

	This is how to use a solder sucker and solder wick: 
	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N\_dvf45hN6Y][5]	

* Multimeter 

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPGoMbVSUu8][6]

* Oscilloscope

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThrK2spjrLs][7] 

* Variable Power Supply

* 3D Printing 

	Wanna use the 3D Printer? Awesome! They live in the WB100 space, not this room. Now before you get crazy know that you are responsible for making sure it works when you are finished with it for the next user. 

	**If you break the printer by misusing it, you have to fix it yourself by the end of the day or pay to have it repaired by a license technician of the Department of Computing’s choice. **
	  
	Only members have access to these machines.

* Laser Cutter 

	Until further notice, this piece of gear is for researchers only. Soon this will change. 

* Circular Woodsaw

	While using the saw, you are required to wear eye and ear protection. After cutting wood, you are required to vacuum the lab and wipe off any dust on any surface. Use only at your own risk after proper training.

	Part 2

* Jigsaw 

	While using the saw, you are required to wear eye and ear protection. After cutting wood, you are required to vacuum the lab and wipe off any dust on any surface. You are also required to bring your own blade. Use only at your own risk after proper training.

#### What the heck is the difference between a small computing platform and a micro controller? 

The small computers are computers. They are far more advanced, have much larger memories, USB ports, video displays and usually their own GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins you can program that will give you control over sensors and actuators. 

A micro controller is much less. It’s usually got a very limited memory like 64k and can only write and read the GPIO pins on the board itself. There’s no saving data here really. If you want to save data you’ll need to have a connected computer and send the data out from the micro controller to a computer.

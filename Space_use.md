# Welcome to The Hatch Lab Hackerspace! 
This space serves to provide increased STEM access to the Goldsmiths student body and the researchers within the Computing  Department. 

As a shared space, it’s very important we set up some ground rules and user polices so this space can support the community. What follows is a list of policies and guidelines for using this space, the gear in it and how we treat each other. 

This space isn’t just a lab where you drop in and out and someone else builds your project. That’s not the way of the Jedi. We are a community where we all hack together to create new frontiers at the edges of what is possible in our field. Give as much as you get. If you learn to solder, why not teach your skills to those around you. This process will build up a healthy, strong community that supports growth, innovation and shared knowledge. 

Together we know more. 

## About the space: 
This room, the former GDS, is now the temporary home to the Hatchlab Hackerspace. Eventually, we will be opening a much larger facility but while construction is occurring this space will serve as a testing ground for policies, space use and the levels of access. How this project succeeds or fails shape the future of the lab and it’s up to us all to help us define the levels of openness, access and resources we have. Together we will build an inspiring community in the Lewisham Area that highlights the creative and engineering efforts of the Goldsmiths community.   

## Participate! 

### Training Sessions
To get access to this space, it’s very important you attend a training session. Sessions run on a per term basis. Please attend the announced session. If you want to know when the next one runs, see the door of the Hatchlab and keep an eye on your email. 

### Craft Nights are also another way to get into the space. 
Thursdays from 6.15 until 8ish this space is open to our Goldsmiths Community. Computing’s resident hacker, Phoenix Perry , will be around hacking and sharing her knowlege and everyone is encouraged to join and bring something awesome to work on. 

There will be mini-skills bootcamps, famous hackers visiting unannounced and general impromptu fun. The only way to know what’s happening is to turn up and take part. 

There will be music! 

There will be science! 

There might even be movies. 

Bring snacks, bring friends and prepare to build cool stuff! Get over here for Craft Night! What are you waiting for?

# Welcome to The Hatch Lab Hackerspace! 
This space serves to provide increased STEM access to the Goldsmiths student body and the researchers within the Computing  Department. 

As a shared space, it’s very important we set up some ground rules and user polices so this space can support the community. What follows is a list of policies and guidelines for using this space, the gear in it and how we treat each other. 

This space isn’t just a lab where you drop in and out and someone else builds your project. That’s not the way of the Jedi. We are a community where we all hack together to create new frontiers at the edges of what is possible in our field. Give as much as you get. If you learn to solder, why not teach your skills to those around you? This process builds up a healthy, strong community that supports growth, innovation and shared knowledge. 

**Together we know more.**

## About the space: 
This room, the former GDS, is now the temporary home to The Goldsmiths Hatchlab Hackerspace. Eventually, we will be opening a much larger facility. While construction is occurring on our final home, this space will serve as a testing ground for policies, space use and the levels of access. How this project succeeds or fails shapes the future of the lab and it’s up to us to help us define the levels of openness, access and resources we have. Together we will build an inspiring community in the Lewisham Area that highlights the creative and engineering efforts of our community.   

## Participate! 

### Training Sessions to become a member
Access to this space is a privilege, not a right and it can be revoked if a user violates the polices laid out for the space. 

To get unsupervised access to this space and become a full member, it’s very important you attend a training session. Sessions run on a per term basis. Please attend the announced session. If you want to know when the next one runs, see the door of the Hatchlab and keep an eye on your email. If you need access and you’re not in one of the groups with access, you can email p.perry@gold.ac.uk to request access. It will only be granted on a case by case basis as our support and faculty allows. 

### Craft Nights  
Thursdays from 6.15 until 8ish this space is open to our Goldsmiths Community. Computing’s resident hacker, Phoenix Perry , will be around hacking and sharing her knowlege and everyone, including non-members, are encouraged to join and bring something awesome to work on. 

There will be mini-skills bootcamps, genius hackers visiting unannounced and general impromptu fun. The only way to know what’s happening is to turn up and take part. 

There will be music! 

There will be science! 

And yes, there will be magic. 

Bring snacks, bring friends and prepare to build stuff. Get over here for Craft Night! What are you waiting for? 

#### Responsibility
Equipment in the space is precious. Respect it. Misuse of gear will result in suspension of access to the space until you have been retrained the following term and possible replacement fees depending on damages. If you see a fellow member not using a piece of gear correctly, help them out and inform them on proper usage. If you see someone disrespecting the space, know it’s hurting everyone. There are no new budgets to buy new gear. Everyone will lose out. Also, if a member of staff sees you destroy a piece of gear, you will be required to replace it. 

Below are guidelines for each item: 
* Wire strippers 

	This is how to cut wire and use the strippers:

* Soldering 

	First off, this is how to solder:

	More information on getting setup, the right iron temp and how to set up here:

	If you need a soldering iron, you are required to **turn the iron off** when you are done. Failure to do so can ruin the irons and mean that no one can ever use it again. It’s vital to do this.

* Desoldering 

	This is how to use a solder sucker and solder wick:

* 3D Printing 

	Wanna use the 3D Printer? Awesome! Now before you get crazy know that **if you break the printer by misusing it, you have to fix it yourself or pay to have it repaired. **
	  
	Only members have access to these machines.

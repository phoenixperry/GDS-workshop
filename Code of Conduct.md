# Code of Conduct 
One of the goals of the Hactchlab is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic status, age, level of experience, personal appearance, ethnicity, religion or philosophy.

The lab is a safe space where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and on social media. Particularly, we want to remind participants and visitors to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, exclusion, or other disrespectful conduct. We promise each other to:
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, we contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
	* Exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions.
	* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
	* Be mindful of other community members.

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to physical harassment, verbal harassment, and any form of sexual assault. Those who violate this policy will either be directed to leave the premises or reported to the authorities.

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please talk with a member of staff.  

Alert the faculty if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. 

We'll treat reports as anonymous submissions, and do our best to work with everyone in private to resolve the conflict.
